// This is a recipe to make french fries. I'm not an expert so I'll try my best. Don't get mad if it doesn't turn out good.

1. Take some potatoes and wash them in cold water.
2. Peel the potatoes. Make sure you don't take much of the insides, and try to take the skin only.
3. Heat a pan, and add oil half filled in the pan.
4. Slice the potatoes into long thin pieces. You don't want to make them too thin. About half a centimeter will do.
5. Place them in the heating oil, and then leave them be for about 5 mins.
6. There you have it, your perfect french fries the black version. :P
7. Don't forget to turn off the gas.
